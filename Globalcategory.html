                                    Updated January 23, 2024

                                    The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) has rejected the planned sale of Shell’s onshore assets, claiming the group being speculated to buy up the assets is unknown to it.

                                    On January 16, Shell said it would sell its Nigerian subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), for a consideration of $1.3 billion, with buyers making an additional payment of up to $1.1 billion relating to prior receivables at completion.

                                    A week later, PENGASSAN issued a statement, saying the purported group is an assemblage of unknown entities with no proven track record of managing such diverse assets.

                                    “We reject without equivocation all the terms affecting employees that were communicated in the presentation to our members,” the statement signed by the association’s Secretary, Comrade Lumumba Okugbawa, and President, Comrade Festus Osifo, read.

                                    “One of the companies that made up the assemblage has a history of subjugating workers and subjecting them to untold hardship as exemplified in the current management of OML 34.

                                    “The group is unknown to us and thus it’s an assemblage of unknown entities with no proven track record in managing such diverse assets.

                                    “Our Shell/SNBO Branch of PENGASSAN has further communicated all subsequent information presented to our members by Shell Management on the planned sale.”

                                    PENGASSAN POSITION ON THE PLANNED SALE OF SHELL ONSHORE ASSETS

                                    The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) ‘s attention has been brought to the press release announcing the intended sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company Limited (SPDC) Onshore Assets to the Renaissance group.

                                    A group of consortiums consisting of ND Western Limited, Aradel Holdings Pic. The Petrolin Group, FIRST Exploration and Petroleum Development Company Limited and the Waltersmith Group.

                                    Our Shell/SNBO Branch of PENGASSAN has further communicated all subsequent information presented to our members by Shell Management on the planned sale.

                                    Having appraised the situation, reviewed the presentation and carried out preliminary findings, we wish to state as follows:

                                    The group is unknown to us and thus it’s an assemblage of unknown entities with no proven track record in managing such diverse assets.

                                    We reject without equivocation all the terms affecting employees that were communicated in the presentation to our members.

                                    One of the companies that made up the assemblage has a history of subjugating workers and subjecting them to untold hardship as exemplified in the current management of OML 34.

                                    Another company in the group has a penchant for preventing workers from unionising and thus stiffening their condition of services.

                                    Any attempt to transfer the assets without resolving issues affecting our members will be met with the stiffest resistance the industry has ever witnessed.

                                    The group must come clean with its intention(s) and be ready to have serious engagement with the Association and not the jamboree that Shell Management is currently engaging in.

                                    We have communicated to our Shell/SNBO Branches not to be distracted but to focus on the CBA negotiation that is due about a week from now

                                    The industry regulator, JV Asset partners (NNPCL, Non-Operated Asset Partners) and other stakeholders are hereby put on notice.

                                    Riot's League of Legends has rapidly grown into one of the most-watched esports in the world, with tens of millions tuning in to livestreams from competitions every year.

                                    By Nebianet Usaini
                                    Updated January 23, 2024
                                    
                                    League of Legends Maker, Riot Games, lays off staff globally.
                                   
                                    League of Legends maker Riot Games said Monday it will cut around 530 jobs worldwide, describing the layoffs as “a necessity.”

                                    The layoffs at Riot — owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent — follow a turbulent year for the gaming industry, with job cuts at major firms including Electronic Arts and Ubisoft.

                                    Riot has developed global hits, including League of Legends and Valorant, but said it has launched too many projects in recent years.

                                    “Today, we’re a company without a sharp enough focus, and simply put, we have too many things underway,” Riot CEO Dylan Jadeja said in an email to staff.

                                    “Some of the significant investments we’ve made aren’t paying off the way we expected them to. Our costs have grown to the point where they’re unsustainable.”

                                    Jadeja said around 530 jobs, or 11 percent of staff, would be cut globally, without providing a breakdown by location.

                                    In addition to its headquarters in Los Angeles, Riot’s website lists offices in 20 locations, including Berlin, Sao Paulo, Seoul and Sydney.

                                    Thousands of people have lost their jobs in the tech sector over the past 18 months, including at some of the world’s biggest gaming companies.

                                    Electronic Arts, Ubisoft and streaming platform Twitch have all announced layoffs in this period.

                                    Riot’s League of Legends has rapidly grown into one of the most-watched esports in the world, with tens of millions tuning in to livestreams from competitions every year.

                                    The final of its world championship is widely considered the esports Super Bowl.

                                    In its statement about the layoffs on Monday, Riot said it would prioritize the teams behind League of Legends and other live games.

                                    It said it would also phase out internal game development division Riot Forge.

                                    Last August, the NNPCL secured a $3.3 billion emergency crude repayment loan from the African Export-Import Bank to stabilize the foreign exchange market.

                                    A photo combination of President Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar.
                                    
                                    Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar on Thursday asked President Bola Tinubu to account for the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL)’s $3.3 billion emergency crude repayment loan.

                                    Last August, the NNPCL secured a $3.3 billion emergency crude repayment loan from the African Export-Import Bank to stabilize the foreign exchange market.

                                    A few weeks ago, the Federal Government received $2.25 billion out of the $3.3 billion FX facility from the African Export-Import Bank.

                                    But reacting to the deal in a statement, the 2023 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), wondered why the only information available to the public on the mega-deal is coming only through sources from the NNPCL. He claimed that a Special Purpose Vehicle called Project Gazelle Funding Limited is driving the deal, and it was incorporated in the Bahamas.

                                    “SPV is the borrower while the NNPCL is the sponsor, with an agreement to pay with crude oil to the SPV in order to liquidate the loan at an interest rate that is a little over 12 per cent,” he said.

                                    “What is even more confounding about this deal is why the Federal Government would register a company in the Bahamas, knowing full well the recent scandal of the Paradise Papers that involved that country.

                                    “Curiously also, Nigeria’s current Barrels Produced Daily (BPD) is 1.38 million, and according to the Project Gazelle deal, Nigeria is to supply 90,000 Barrels of its daily production, starting from 2024 till it is up to 164.25 million barrels for the repayment of the loan.

                                    “Now, this is where the details get disturbing because Nigeria’s benchmark for the sale of crude per barrel in 2024 is $77.96. A simple multiplication of that figure by 164.25 will give us a whooping $12bn.

                                    “It is on this note that we are calling on the Federal Government to speak up on this shady deal. It is inconceivable that the Federal Government will lead the country to take a loan of $3.3b with an interest rate that is not more than 12 percent, but with estimated repayment amounting to $12bn.

                                    “That is a humongous differential of about $7b between what is in the details of the deal on paper and what indeed is the reality,” the statement read.

                                    The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Yemi Cardoso, has declared that the Nigerian naira is undervalued, promising to expedite the discovery of genuine price in the near term.

                                    He said, “We believe that the naira is currently undervalued, and coupled with the coordinated measures on the fiscal side, we will expedite genuine price discovery in the near term. This coordinated approach will contribute to a more balanced and stable exchange rate.”

                                    The CBN Governor, who spoke at the 2024 Macroeconomic Outlook of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) on Wednesday, also said that the apex bank is looking at an inflation rate of 21.4 per cent under its inflation-targeting regime.

                                    “The anticipated moderation in pump prices of PMS, due to the expected operational status of the country’s government and private-owned refineries in 2024 is a pivotal factor in the economic equation.

                                    “The economic stabilisation or reduction in fuel cost is poised to have far-reaching implications across various sectors, contributing significantly to overall economic efficiency and resilience. Inflationary pressures are expected to decline in 2024 due to the CBN’s inflation-targeting policy, which aims to rein in inflation to 21.4 per cent.

                                    “This will be aided by improved agricultural productivity and the easing of global supply chain pressures, benefiting businesses by boosting consumer confidence and purchasing power,” Cardoso said.

                                    The adoption of inflation targeting framework according to the CBN Chief, involves clear communication, use of monetary policy instruments and collaboration with fiscal authorities to achieve price stability and positively influence consumer behaviour.

                                    He maintained that declining inflation will have a great impact on businesses, providing a more predictable cost environment and potentially, leading to lower policy rates, stimulating investment, stimulating growth and creating job opportunities.
