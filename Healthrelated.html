                                    The Federal Government is set to ban single-use plastic products (SUPs) and styrofoam in ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs). 
                                   
                                    The Minister of State for Environment, Iziaq Salako, gave the indication in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, during a workshop and capacity building for chemicals and waste handlers, held on Tuesday.

                                    The minister, who commending the state government for the initiative, highlighted some of the measures being taken to promote circular economy which include strengthening relevant policies and institutional framework, building the capacity of manufacturers and producers to embrace the principle of cleaner production and enforcement of national policies on chemical management.
                                    
                                    The minister seized the occasion to reiterate the commitment of the Federal Government to the elimination of single-used plastics as he implored government department and offices to comply with the new directive.
                                    
                                    The second edition of the Chemical Handlers and Users Workshop was at the instance of the Ogun State Ministry of Environment to intimate stakeholders on the need to safeguard the health of the people and the environment by adopting best practices in chemicals handling and waste management.
                                    
                                    The seminar was attended by the state environment minister; the Ogun State Deputy Governor, Noimot Salako-Oyedele; members of the State Executive Council; members of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria; among other critical stakeholders.
                                    
                                    According to them, unchecked handling of waste and chemicals have been responsible for loss of biodiversity, pollution of underground water and increase of non-communicable diseases.
                                    
                                    With this in mind, they called for the embrace of circular solutions in chemical and waste management to guarantee more efficient production.

                                    The Georgia Department of Public Health has confirmed a case of measles in metro Atlanta, the first since 2020.

                                    “DPH is working to identify anyone who may have had contact with the individual while they were infectious,” the department said in a statement. “Measles is very contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles virus can stay in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person has left the room.”

                                    Symptoms of measles usually appear one to two weeks after exposure and can include high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes followed by a rash of tiny red spots. In some cases, patients can develop potentially fatal complications including pneumonia and swelling of the brain.

                                    If you have symptoms of measles, call your doctor, clinic or hospital and tell them about it before going in, the DPH says.

                                    Young children, pregnant women and older adults are at the greatest risk, but most Americans do not need to worry about catching it. Measles is preventable with two doses of a vaccine called MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), which doctors recommend for all babies as part of their routine health care.

                                    “One case is one too many and runs the risk of spreading to other unvaccinated children and children who are unprotected, including those who are immunocompromised,” said Dr. Harry Heiman, a public health professor at Georgia State University.

                                    The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children get their first dose of MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months and their second dose between 4 and 6 years old. More than 95% of the people who receive a single dose of MMR will develop immunity to all three viruses. A second dose boosts immunity, typically enhancing protection to 98%, DPH says.

                                    The first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963, and the vaccine offered today has been in use since 1968, according to the CDC.

                                    The vaccines were so successful that measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 – to doctors, elimination means there was no continuous spread within the country for one year; completely reducing a disease to zero worldwide is called eradication.

                                    Measles is still considered eliminated in the U.S., though cases still arise when people travel to and from other countries where the virus is endemic. The current metro Atlanta patient was exposed to measles while traveling abroad, according to Georgia DPH.

                                    Last year, the CDC reported 48 measles cases nationwide, down from 121 in 2022, but five years ago, an outbreak infected more than 1,200 people, for a time threatening the disease’s elimination status in the U.S. The vast majority of those cases were in close-knit communities among people who were not vaccinated.

                                    A CDC report found that nationwide, the number of new kindergarten students with an exemption for any vaccine rose .4% to 3%, the highest exemption rate ever reported. Nonmedical exemptions make up more than 90% of the total and account for approximately 100% of the growth in the exemption rate.

                                    Georgia’s kindergarten exemption rate fell by .9% from the previous school year, but at 3.8%, it is still higher than the national average.

                                    “The more critical number is the percentage who are vaccinated and, therefore, protected,” Heiman said. “For Georgia, during the 2022-2023 school year, this number was 88%. Unfortunately, that means there are many students who are unprotected and at-risk for contracting measles. I would hope that this case serves as a wake-up call for schools, health care providers and our public health agencies to focus additional resources to ensuring that systems are in place to make sure that all Georgia’s children are up to date on these critical vaccines.”

                                    A World Health Organization and CDC report found measles on the rise worldwide, with cases in 2022 increasing 18% to 9 million and deaths up 43% to 136,000, mostly among children.

                                    Part of the increase may be a lingering effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO officials say, as millions of children worldwide skipped doses of routine vaccinations because of pandemic restrictions and lockdowns and never got them. As of November, researchers estimate that 22 million kids missed their first dose and 11 million missed their second.

                                    “Measles cases anywhere pose a risk to all countries and communities where people are under-vaccinated,” said John Vertefeuille, director of CDC’s Global Immunization Division in a statement. “Urgent, targeted efforts are critical to prevent measles disease and deaths.”

                                    Cameroon on Monday made history as the first country in the world to integrate malaria vaccine into its routine immunisation programme, making it the right of every child.

                                    It introduced the RTSs malaria vaccine in 42 districts with populations at the highest disease risk.

                                    Cameroon secured 662,000 doses from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in an initial rollout of 18 million doses allocated to 12 African countries.

                                    Nigeria missed the chance to grab part of the consignment and now waits in line for a second malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, which could be recommended for use and potentially available by the first quarter of this year.

                                    The vaccine evaluated in large clinical trials and large-scale implementation programmes in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi has significantly reduced malaria illness and deaths.

                                    Cameroon is a country where malaria cases and deaths have been rising since 2017, with nearly 30 percent of all hospital consultations related to malaria.

                                    “The vaccination shots will be available to all eligible children in the clinics. The Gavi Alliance has worked with partners, including the Global Fund to make sure vaccination is delivered as part of a package of essential interventions, including bed nets, for example,” Aurelia Nguyen, chief program officer at Gavi said, speaking during a briefing on the commencement of routine malaria immunization across Africa.

                                    “The vaccination will save lives and provide major relief to families and the country’s health system, yielding important economic dividends across the African continent.”

                                    Nguyen said about 20 more countries have plans to introduce the vaccine this year as some have already received their shipment doses and are making their preparations for launch.

                                    The European Union (EU) has announced an investment of €18 million to fund vaccine research in Nigeria.

                                    The Head of the EU Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Amb. Samuela Isopi, disclosed this in Abuja at the presentation of the National Plan for Vaccine Research and Development and Local Production 2024-2034.

                                    The plan, developed by the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD) with support from the EU and the Bulgarian Government, was unveiled recently.

                                    Isopi, represented by Prof. Leila Mathieu, stated that the EU’s alignment with Nigeria’s priorities is evident in this initiative.

                                    She stressed the timeliness of the plan’s development and its alignment with national priorities.

                                    Isopi said that discussions are ongoing at the highest levels with the EU to explore further aspects of the plan.

                                    She said, “When we do a plan, we have to put money in research, but then manufacturing must follow.

                                    “So, we are going to invest 18 million euros in research in vaccines in Nigeria with full grants to some public research institutions and other implementing partners.”


                                    According to her, the EU’s investment aims to enhance research in vaccines with grants provided to public research institutions and other implementing partners.

                                    She further added that the EU is working closely with Bulgaria on the initiative, which is part of a larger Team Europe initiative with Africa for vaccine manufacturing.

                                    “We will be working closely with your ministry and of course your public institutions on that and we will be working closely also in a Team Europe spirit with Bulgaria.

                                    “Manufacturing of vaccines is a Team Europe initiative with Africa on a continental level so we have other partners at African level.

                                    “I also heard from the minister that you were aiming at having a biomedical institute in the capital and that’s also something we could look into and link to research but probably also research on vaccines as well.”

                                    Ambassador Yanko Yordanov of Bulgaria spoke about his ambition to strengthen the partnership with Nigeria in the health sector, viewing it as an investment in global health.

                                    He assured Bulgaria’s commitment to the project, including providing funding and expertise in vaccine research and development.

                                    “The national plan is the first step; the implementation is what matters and Bulgaria is more than willing to be part of this implementation, both as a partner who provides funding, but also with our own national expert base.

                                    “So in Bulgaria, you can count on a vast array of experts in terms of research, development and implementation of vaccines.

                                    “I can reassure you that what we are aiming to do is definitely a sustainable, long term partnership that will transcend throughout the years,” he said, adding that “the EU is a generous organisation to Africa, and had taken note of Nigeria’s request for more funding and will do what is appropriate in that regard.”

                                    Earlier, the Minister of State for Health and Social Welfare, Dr. Tunji Alausa, expressed his gratitude to the EU and Bulgaria for their support.

                                    He stressed the urgency of local vaccine production in Nigeria, where currently less than one percent of vaccines used are produced domestically.

                                    “This national plan covers the entire ecosystem of what we need to do with domesticating our vaccine production.

                                    “This is a document that will be used nationally, NIPRD has taken the lead on this and it will be used as a template into actualising the end.


                                    “The frontal part is done, now let’s go to the operationalisation part and I thank you for the Bulgarian commitment to now support in partnering with us into the next phase.

                                    “We want the Bulgarian Government to use its influence in the EU to look at us as a big population to get the subsequent research grant support that we need,” he added.

                                    The NIPRD Director-General, Dr. Obi Adigwe, emphasized that the document’s presentation marks a significant step toward initiating local vaccine production in Nigeria.

                                    He noted the importance of local manufacturing for enhancing access to vaccines and public health outcomes, as well as fostering innovation, capacity building, and socio-economic development.

                                    He said, “The need to develop local capacity for pharmaceutical manufacturing became more prominent.

                                    “As you all are aware, access to vaccines is key towards achieving Universal Health Coverage because vaccines can also prevent the financial burden of treating diseases and save the citizenry from high medical costs.”

                                    The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 10-year plan outlines strategies for promoting vaccine research and development, reducing vaccine hesitancy, improving vaccine access, and shifting towards local production in both public and private health sectors.
