                                    A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Segun Sowunmi, has slammed the Federal Government for “running the economy on palliatives” since the removal of petrol subsidy some eight months ago.

                                    Sowunmi, who was a guest on Channels Television’s Politics Today programme on Monday, called on the President Bola Tinubu administration to increase workers’ salaries in earnest.

                                    With 28.92% inflation rate, 33.93% food Inflation, 18.75% interest rate, over 133 million multidimensionally poor Nigerians, 33.3% unemployment rate, Naira exchange rate at over N1400/US$ in the parallel market, price per litre of petrol at over N600, and many more, Nigerians have not had it this tough economically.

                                    Segun Sowunmi on Politics Today programme on January 29, 2024
                                    
                                    Sowunmi lamented that the naira is going down and those saddled with fiscal responsibilities don’t know how to stabilise the currency which he said is now “a joke” even to those spending Cefas in francophone West Africa.

                                    He argued that the Nigerian economy should not be built for impressive Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and stock exchange figures or for the applause of global rating bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

                                    Instead, the PDP chieftain said the Nigerian economy should be built for common Nigerians who are struggling to survive, many of whom don’t know where their next meal would come from.

                                    He said, “On the economy, he (Tinubu) needs to let people understand, especially Wale Edun, (Yemi) Cardoso and all of them, he (Tinubu) needs to let them understand that: ‘I am not trying to build an economy solely for GDP so that Bretton Woods organisations such as the World Bank and IMF can be giving me pass marks. I am not interested; I am interested in building an economy that is resilience, serves the poor people of Nigerian and give them the opportunity to live the type of life that the Renewed Hope is supposed to be’.

                                    “Let me tell you what would have happened if he had increased salaries of civil servants, they have been getting that increased salaries in a sustained manner, private sector would have followed up to keep their workforce, that money would have gone back into the market and you would have seen the economy growing.

                                    “You can’t run a big economy on palliatives, especially when you are running the palliatives on wholesales and not retail.”

                                    Sowunmi feared that Tinubu might lose the economy though it is his strong point, urging the President to prioritise economic stability and country-wide prosperity beyond enriching a few corrupt persons.

                                    Renowned economist and Managing Director of Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Bismarck Rewane, says the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should meet beyond four times a year to review economic and financial conditions and stem galloping inflation.
                                    
                                                                        
                                    Rewane was a guest on the Business Morning segment of Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily breakfast show during the week.
                                                                                               
                                    
                                    Enjoy the excerpts of the interview:
                                                                         
                                    
                                    Last year, Mr Cardoso had told us that the CBN Act allows them to hold at least four MPC meetings and that was fulfilled for 2023. This is 2024 and we’re beginning with February. I know that before the dates were made known we did get some jitters from investors — issues of uncertainties, the rates have just been there and all of that. Does this announcement make any difference?
                                                                         
                                                                   
                                    It surely does. First of all, let us correct something, the monetary policy committee is an independent committee which which is made up of people from the central bank and outsiders and they meet every two months to reflect on what the monetary policy is and make decisions which will affect the monetary policy in the economy — high interest rates, money supply and inflation. Now, I respectfully disagree with the governor when he says the minimum number of times they have to meet is four. The minimum number of times is not the maximum number of times. Since July when the committee met last and now which is seven months, the inflation has increased by almost 5 to 6%; it’s almost 30%. So, in times like this, you have to meet more often as a matter of fact you burst all the the frontiers and meet more often to address the issues.
                                                                      
                                                                        
                                    So, now that there’s going to be a meeting in February, I think that they will have to do the right thing. The first thing is that they will have to address what is causing inflation. Inflation is caused by so many factors: money supply, the price of diesel, exchange rate pass through… all of these things have to be addressed while at the same time ensuring that you complement the fiscal policy of the country to ensure that there’s macroeconomic stability. I think that’s the main cost. The expectations that we are going to see about anything at least 150 basis points to 200 basis points this time but the consensus, according to Bloomberg, is that for the year of 2024, we are going to see interest rates increase by about 300 to 400% in this period. That is what Bloomberg is saying after talking to economists.
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    Having said that, you must understand that the increasing the MPR itself is not enough, there must be a complete, the effective interest rate in the economy must increase — one to rein in money supply, and two, to stabilise the Naira. You talked a minute ago about NNPC using short-term loans and facilities from Afreximbank to stabilise the naira. In all due respect, that’s not going to solve the problem of at this point. The naira is still under pressure and it’s trading at 1,350 naira per dollar which is the the lowest point it has got to in many years; it’s a record low.
                                    
                                     
                                    
                                    Before we even talk about some of those expectations, what about the committee of the MPC? I believe the individuals that make up the committee also determine the result of the meeting because these people will come with their experience and their perspectives and I believe Mr Cardoso is not working with the former committee. So, who should make up a committee that would be able to look at the right direction and make the right decision for forward movement for the MPC?
                                    
                                     
                                    
                                    The Monetary Policy Committee is appointed by the President, the governor and some other recommendations; they draw them from the academia, business people with business experience and all of that, and they are confirmed by the Senate. I’m not aware that the Monetary Policy Committee that was last approved by the Senate who have a term of two years have been dissolved. So, it will be news to Nigerians to hear that the Monetary Policy Committee has been dissolved without going through a process. I suspect that we will still be using the old committee and if there’s going to be a change in committee, what time would you have to appoint them, to get the Senate to confirm them and for them to meet before February 26th. The time is too short, it looks like something that is an afterthought. So let us expect for now until we are told otherwise that the Monetary Policy Committee has approved by the Senate will remain and do their job. It’s an independent committee and their input is very necessary for macroeconomic stability.
                                    
                                  
                                    Now that the governor has said that the central bank will be working with inflation target, what different does it make to conversations around the MPC and of course, the results they come out with?
                                   
                                    Inflation targeting is a framework. What we call the Monetary Policy Framework and then you anchor expectations using what we call the nominal anchor which is the MPR and that also pulls along other interest rates in the economy so you look at money supply aggregates which is an intermediate anchor. You look at inflation itself and broken down into core food and other inflation. Then you look at the factors that are stocking inflation and then you look at all of this, you look at growth and look at unemployment and all, so that basically the monetary policy of the country actually is used to correct either when you have loose monetary conditions or when you have excess liquidity and what we call money supply saturation.
                                    
                                    
                                    What has happened in the past seven to eight months and even before that is that we’ve seen money supply increase at about almost 39% while growth is only about 2 or 3%. So, ab initio, you have about 36% inflation factor. On top of that, we’ve seen the price of diesel which is a major stocking factor. The price of diesel has gone up to over N1,200 per litre. We’ve seen the exchange rate because the naira has dropped sharply since June when it was trading at about N800 in the parallel market; it’s now about N1,300, it lost half of its value in no time. All of these things put together means that the Monetary Policy Committee has to meet and have to deliberate and go in a granular fashion to address the issues and address them so that the price of commodities begin to actually moderate and that people begin to have purchasing power. There are so many factors that are going on at the same time including wages including government spending and expenditure. These are critical issues.
                                    
                                     
                                    Very critical issue but another critical one is the area of energy and I think it’s about two weeks since Dangote Refineries started operations. Of course, we are all happy for that and we’re waiting with baited breath. Please help us to understand the process.
                                    
                                     
                                    Let me correct one thing, the Dangote Refinery is commencing production and in another week or so, the products will come out in the market.  There’s been initial production and everything going into the tanks but one thing is clear that there’ll be adequate supply. The last time we checked, about 33 million litres of diesel will be produced. There’s also dual-purpose kerosine. There is a question of how it is going to be evacuated to the market. 70% of the evacuation is going to come by marine vessels and about 30% by trucks that are coming in through Ogun State and Epe so it does not cause any disruption to
                                    
                                    the Lagos traffic. Lagos traffic is bad enough with the closure of the Third Mainland Bridge. The Dangote Refinery knowing very well that this is necessary had made adequate arrangements to ensure that they don’t compound the problems of Nigerians in terms of traffic in Lagos and the downtime to the economy.
                                    
                                    Secondly, it guarantees supply and basically,  with guaranteed supply, you will find that prices will moderate but prices are made up of cost plus the margin. So, I don’t think anybody should be fooled or get into the imagination that because the refinery is working now, prices are going to crash. You cannot sell below your marginal cost. You produce, your marginal cost equals your marginal revenue. But one thing clear is that there will be guaranteed supply and that it will also make sure that the supply goes across the country to various areas.
                                    
                                    Also, we should bear in mind that because diesel shortages and shocks lead to inflationary pressures, once you have guaranteed supply, it will help to moderate inflation and put the economy in a good stead. The total investment in the refinery is in excess of $23 billion. That is almost 25% of the gross fixed investment of this country. The Dangote Group, I think they are the second or highest corporate payers of corporate income tax in this country. All of these things have to be put into consideration as a major milestone for Nigeria and the West African region. It’s not just a Nigerian entity; this is the single largest refinery in the world. 650,000 barrels a day. So, I think we have to put that into consideration. Having said that, we must understand that this is not a saver bullet that will solve our problems; it’s a necessary condition to moving Nigeria closer to microeconomic stability and investors of this nature like the NNPC and others should be encouraged to do more and not discouraged.
                                    
                                    Now we have our Port Harcourt Refinery, the mechanical rehabilitation is done, at least the first phase. We have Dangote. We also hear news in states — encouragement of modular refineries. Can we expect that by the end of 2024, Nigeria or Nigerians will be energy sufficient and independent.
                                    
                                    Quite frankly, with the full commissioning of the Dangote Refinery, when all products are coming out, Nigeria will be self-sufficient and will have capacity to service the whole of Western and Central Africa, no question about about that. So, it’s not the sufficiency of products; it is just the the quantity and the quality that is produced. And right now, what we’ve been doing is that we export our oil through Trafigura Glencore, they refine it for us and bring it back. It’s a very opaque system which is not open to to transparency. Now, with this system we have, when you have excess supplies, then you’ll find out that the prices will begin to moderate and supply is guaranteed. The same thing happened in cement. There was a time when Nigeria was a major importer of cement in the 70s but because of the activities of Dangote, Lafarge, and others, we now are net exporters of cement and aggregate.
                                    
                                    That hasn’t helped the price of cement.
                                    
                                    Well, price is a function of cost and supply and demand. So, there’s nothing that says that once supply increases and cost does not reduce that prices will come down because people will produce at where their marginal cost equals their marginal revenue. They will not produce at any point higher or lower than that but one thing is sure that if you look at the price of a bag of cement now, maybe 5,000 to 6,000 naira and look at it five years ago, compared with inflationary trend in all other commodities, you find that cement has actually not moved as fast as it would, like other commodities because of the guaranteed supply in the country. There are other factors that goes into cement production; the cost of energy, the finances and all that but the discussion today is about how can we use refined products to stabilise logistics in this country. Don’t forget that that people have to transport goods from industry to markets and from markets across the region. So, once we get the logistics right which is one of the major factors that lead to inflation in this country, then inflation begins to moderate. If inflation moderates, the exchange rate begins to appreciate and you can see that in the last two days, maybe based on force expectation, the exchange rate moderated a little bit and I’m not sure that that is sustainable at this time.

                                    The Federal Government will introduce more crop varieties to farmers in the country following the introduction of the TELA maize. 

                                    By Emmanuel Egobiambu
                                    Updated January 23, 2024

                                    The Federal Government will introduce more crop varieties to farmers in the country following the introduction of the TELA maize. 
                                    
                                    On January 11, the National Committee on Naming, Registration, and Release of Crop Varieties, Livestock Breeds/Fisheries approved the commercial release and open cultivation of the transgenic insect-resistant and drought-tolerant maize varieties.
                                    
                                    But weeks after the move, Nigeria’s Minister of Innovation, Science, and Technology Uche Nnaji said the ministry is “actively pursuing the release of several other crops”.
                                    
                                    “Esteemed Members of the Fourth Estate, it is important to note that this release is just a glimpse of the transformative potential at our disposal. NABDA, in collaboration with various stakeholders and foreign collaborators is actively pursuing the release of several other crops, each poised to revolutionise our agricultural productivity and fortify our nation’s food security,” he said in a Tuesday press conference at the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) office in Abuja.
                                    
                                    READ ALSO: Nigeria’s Inflation Rate Rises To 28.9%
                                    
                                    He, however, encouraged farmers to embrace the newly-released maize varieties, saying they are a step “towards a more prosperous, sustainable, and food-secure future for Nigeria”.
                                    
                                    Nnaji said the January release of the new crop varieties for open cultivation “marks a remarkable step to enhance agricultural productivity and ensure food sufficiency for our nation.
                                    
                                    “It exemplifies our commitment to harnessing the power of biotechnology to address pressing agricultural challenges, enhance crop resilience, and improve the livelihoods of our farmers and citizens. It also strengthens our position in the global agricultural landscape, fostering economic stability and opening new avenues for trade and export.”
                                    
                                    The minister thanked NABDA for their “relentless efforts and support” which were instrumental to the “groundbreaking achievement”.
                                    
                                    “Their dedication has been pivotal in advancing our agricultural sector, and I applaud their tireless commitment to boosting food security and agricultural sustainability,” he added.
                                    
                                    While appreciating partners that made the feat a success, he praised President Bola Tinubu for being a “source of inspiration”.
                                    
                                    He said, “Mr. President’s salutary commitment to turning innovation into an engine of growth is a source of inspiration to us at the Ministry and in the various parastatals under my auspices.
                                    
                                    “I extend my heartfelt appreciation to the dedicated and innovative scientists,
                                    researchers, experts, institutions, and foreign collaborators who have contributed to the development and release of these transgenic crop varieties.”

                                <p>
                                    Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Yemi Cardoso has stated that the naira is undervalued promising that in 2024, the bank will work towards real price discovery in the foreign exchange market.

                                    Mr Cardoso stated this while delivering the keynote address at the Nigeria Economic Group outlook for 2024 via video conference.

                                    According to Cardoso, the apex bank will execute inflation-taming policies through monetary policy instruments and collaboration with the fiscal side of the economy which is the Ministry of Finance.

                                    He also promised to shrine discipline in the forex market and promptly address any infractions and abuses.

                                    He stated,

                                    “We believe that the naira is currently undervalued, And coupled with coordinated measures on the fiscal side, we will expedite genuine price discovery in the near term. This coordinated approach will contribute to a more balanced and stable exchange rate”
                                    The naira traded at N878.61 on the official market according to Nairametrics daily FX monitor yesterday but recorded N1360/$1 on the unofficial market.

                                    Increasing the FX reserve
                                    On increasing the FX reserves, Mr Cardoso stated that the bank’s partnership with the Ministry of Finance and NNPCL ensures all foreign exchange inflow is returned to the bank as it will result in the accretion of the country’s foreign reserve.

                                    Taming inflation
                                    The Governor also noted that the anticipated resumption of operations in the three refineries across the country will contribute to a reduction in the pump prices of PMS which is a major contributor to the CPI basket.

                                    He also noted that the inflation outlook is geared towards increasing economic growth and a more predictive cost environment.

                                    He stated, “Inflationary pressures are expected to decline in 2024 due to the CBN’s inflation-targeting policy, which aims to rein in inflation to 21.4%,”

                                    “The outlook for decreasing inflation in 2024 will have a profound impact on businesses, providing a more predictable cost environment and potentially leading to lower policy rates, stimulating investment, fueling growth, and creating job opportunities,”
