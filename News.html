                                    The Federal Government will introduce more crop varieties to farmers in the country following the introduction of the TELA maize. 
                                    
                                    On January 11, the National Committee on Naming, Registration, and Release of Crop Varieties, Livestock Breeds/Fisheries approved the commercial release and open cultivation of the transgenic insect-resistant and drought-tolerant maize varieties.
                                    
                                    But weeks after the move, Nigeria’s Minister of Innovation, Science, and Technology Uche Nnaji said the ministry is “actively pursuing the release of several other crops”.
                                    
                                    “Esteemed Members of the Fourth Estate, it is important to note that this release is just a glimpse of the transformative potential at our disposal. NABDA, in collaboration with various stakeholders and foreign collaborators is actively pursuing the release of several other crops, each poised to revolutionise our agricultural productivity and fortify our nation’s food security,” he said in a Tuesday press conference at the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) office in Abuja.

                                    He, however, encouraged farmers to embrace the newly-released maize varieties, saying they are a step “towards a more prosperous, sustainable, and food-secure future for Nigeria”.
                                    
                                    Nnaji said the January release of the new crop varieties for open cultivation “marks a remarkable step to enhance agricultural productivity and ensure food sufficiency for our nation.
                                    
                                    “It exemplifies our commitment to harnessing the power of biotechnology to address pressing agricultural challenges, enhance crop resilience, and improve the livelihoods of our farmers and citizens. It also strengthens our position in the global agricultural landscape, fostering economic stability and opening new avenues for trade and export.”
                                    
                                    The minister thanked NABDA for their “relentless efforts and support” which were instrumental to the “groundbreaking achievement”.
                                    
                                    “Their dedication has been pivotal in advancing our agricultural sector, and I applaud their tireless commitment to boosting food security and agricultural sustainability,” he added.
                                    
                                    While appreciating partners that made the feat a success, he praised President Bola Tinubu for being a “source of inspiration”.
                                    
                                    He said, “Mr. President’s salutary commitment to turning innovation into an engine of growth is a source of inspiration to us at the Ministry and in the various parastatals under my auspices.
                                    
                                    “I extend my heartfelt appreciation to the dedicated and innovative scientists,
                                    researchers, experts, institutions, and foreign collaborators who have contributed to the development and release of these transgenic crop varieties.”

                                <p>
                                    Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Yemi Cardoso has stated that the naira is undervalued promising that in 2024, the bank will work towards real price discovery in the foreign exchange market.

                                    Mr Cardoso stated this while delivering the keynote address at the Nigeria Economic Group outlook for 2024 via video conference.

                                    According to Cardoso, the apex bank will execute inflation-taming policies through monetary policy instruments and collaboration with the fiscal side of the economy which is the Ministry of Finance.

                                    He also promised to shrine discipline in the forex market and promptly address any infractions and abuses.

                                    He stated,

                                    “We believe that the naira is currently undervalued, And coupled with coordinated measures on the fiscal side, we will expedite genuine price discovery in the near term. This coordinated approach will contribute to a more balanced and stable exchange rate”
                                    The naira traded at N878.61 on the official market according to Nairametrics daily FX monitor yesterday but recorded N1360/$1 on the unofficial market.

                                    Increasing the FX reserve
                                    On increasing the FX reserves, Mr Cardoso stated that the bank’s partnership with the Ministry of Finance and NNPCL ensures all foreign exchange inflow is returned to the bank as it will result in the accretion of the country’s foreign reserve.

                                    Taming inflation
                                    The Governor also noted that the anticipated resumption of operations in the three refineries across the country will contribute to a reduction in the pump prices of PMS which is a major contributor to the CPI basket.

                                    He also noted that the inflation outlook is geared towards increasing economic growth and a more predictive cost environment.

                                    He stated, “Inflationary pressures are expected to decline in 2024 due to the CBN’s inflation-targeting policy, which aims to rein in inflation to 21.4%,”

                                    “The outlook for decreasing inflation in 2024 will have a profound impact on businesses, providing a more predictable cost environment and potentially leading to lower policy rates, stimulating investment, fueling growth, and creating job opportunities,”
